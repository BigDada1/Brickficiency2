# Back in business!
This fork of Brickficiency has been updated for compatibility with BrickLink v2.0.  Some functionality has had minor changes or improvements that I hope users will appreciate.

__About Brickficiency__

Brickficiency finds all combinations of Bricklink stores that can supply all items in a list, and returns them in order of total cost.

__Known issues__
* Composite parts/assemblies currently don't work
* LDD import may not map all items or colors correctly, but I'm not convinced it did before either.  Please report instances where this does not function correctly.

__Roadmap__

During the retrofit I took the liberty to start refactoring the application using a more object-oriented approach.  This will be a long and arduous task but it has to start somewhere.  Once this is cleaned up a bit more I'm going to work on reincorporating some performance optimizations I was working on before the BrickLink v2.0 change.
