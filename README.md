Brickficiency is no longer supported
With the advent of Bricklink 2.0, Brickficiency is no longer needed. The auto-finder may not be perfect, but it's quite a lot faster and easier to use than Brickficiency. I've left this page her for posterity, but the database behind Brickficiency is no longer available.
